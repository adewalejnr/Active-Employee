This SQL query retrieves comprehensive information about staff members, their credentials, and organizational affiliations by combining data from multiple related tables. It uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) to identify the earliest credentials for staff members with multiple credentials, ensuring only valid and non-expired entries are included. 

The query leverages the LISTAGG function with ON OVERFLOW TRUNCATE to aggregate distinct credentials, billing categories, and group names into single columns for better readability and reporting. Conditional logic is applied to format the "Primary_Credential" and "credentials" columns accurately. 

Several joins are implemented, including left joins, to ensure all employees are included in the result set, even if they lack specific credential data. Filters are applied to exclude records related to training or test staff and to ensure that only current employees with valid employment dates are considered. 

The query also integrates email addresses from multiple sources using COALESCE to prioritize primary addresses. The result set is ordered by staff full name and last login date for clarity, with inline comments documenting key enhancements and modifications for maintainability. This query is designed to provide a detailed and accurate view of staff data for reporting and analysis.
